faq:
  - question: "Why do I need birth time for houses?"
    answer: "The houses are determined by the exact degree of the eastern horizon at your birth moment, which changes every 4 minutes. Without accurate birth time, your house placements could be completely wrong, even if your planet signs are correct."
  - question: "What if I have empty houses in my birth chart?"
    answer: "Empty houses are normal and don't mean that life area is unimportant. The sign on the cusp and its ruling planet still influence that house. Most people have 4-6 empty houses — planets cluster, they don't spread evenly."
  - question: "What's the most important house in astrology?"
    answer: "The 1st house (Rising sign) is foundational as it sets up all other houses. The 10th house (career/public image) and 7th house (relationships) are also major. But the 'most important' depends on your life priorities and where your planets fall."
  - question: "What does it mean to have many planets in one house?"
    answer: "A stellium (3+ planets in one house) means that life area is a major focus for you. It can indicate both gifts and challenges. Someone with a 7th house stellium will have relationships as a central life theme, for better or worse."
  - question: "Do the houses change during your life?"
    answer: "Your natal houses never change, but transiting planets move through your houses constantly, activating different life areas. When Saturn transits your 10th house, career becomes a focus. This is how timing works in astrology."

So you've got planets in signs. Great. But where do they actually play out in your life?

That's what the houses tell you.

If signs are *how* energy expresses, houses are *where* it shows up. Think of them as 12 different departments of your life — career, relationships, money, home, etc.

Every birth chart has all 12 houses. Where your planets fall determines which areas of life are most active (and sometimes most challenging) for you.

Let's go through each one.

## How Houses Work

Your birth chart is a circle divided into 12 sections, like a pie. Each section is a house, numbered 1-12 counterclockwise starting from the left side (the eastern horizon at your birth time).

The sign on the edge of each house (called the "cusp") gives that house its flavor. The planets inside each house are the main characters in that life area.

Empty houses don't mean nothing happens there — just that it's less of a focus in this lifetime.

## The 12 Houses

---

### 2nd House: The House of Value

---

### 8th House: The House of Transformation
**Keywords:** Sex, death, rebirth, other people's money, inheritance, taxes, psychology, the occult

**Questions it answers:**
- How do I handle intimacy?
- What's my relationship with shared resources (inheritance, partner's money)?
- Where will I experience profound transformation?

### 9th House: The House of Expansion

---

### 10th House: The House of Career

**Questions it answers:**
- What's my career path?
- What will I be known for?

### 12th House: The House of the Subconscious
**Keywords:** Hidden things, spirituality, self-undoing, isolation, karma, dreams, hospitals/prisons

This is what's hidden — your subconscious, your karma, and the things you do behind closed doors (including self-sabotage).

**Questions it answers:**
- What am I not seeing about myself?
- What are my hidden patterns?

## What If a House Is Empty?

Empty houses are normal — you only have 10 planets to spread across 12 houses.

An empty house doesn't mean nothing happens in that life area. It just means:
1. That area isn't a major focus this lifetime
2. You look to the sign on the cusp and its ruling planet for information
3. It may be less eventful but still functions

Busy houses (multiple planets) get more action. Empty houses run on autopilot.
