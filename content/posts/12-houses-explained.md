So you've got planets in signs. Great. But where do they actually play out in your life?

That's what the houses tell you.

If signs are *how* energy expresses, houses are *where* it shows up. Think of them as 12 different departments of your life — career, relationships, money, home, etc.

Every birth chart has all 12 houses. Where your planets fall determines which areas of life are most active (and sometimes most challenging) for you.

Let's go through each one.

## How Houses Work

Your birth chart is a circle divided into 12 sections, like a pie. Each section is a house, numbered 1-12 counterclockwise starting from the left side (the eastern horizon at your birth time).

The sign on the edge of each house (called the "cusp") gives that house its flavor. The planets inside each house are the main characters in that life area.

Empty houses don't mean nothing happens there — just that it's less of a focus in this lifetime.

## The 12 Houses

## What If a House Is Empty?

Empty houses are normal — you only have 10 planets to spread across 12 houses.

An empty house doesn't mean nothing happens in that life area. It just means:
1. That area isn't a major focus this lifetime
2. You look to the sign on the cusp and its ruling planet for information
3. It may be less eventful but still functions

Busy houses (multiple planets) get more action. Empty houses run on autopilot.
