faq:
  - question: "How often does Mars go retrograde?"
    answer: "Mars goes retrograde approximately every 26 months for about 2-2.5 months. It's one of the rarer retrogrades, which is why it feels so disruptive when it happens."
  - question: "What should I avoid during Mars retrograde?"
    answer: "Avoid starting major new projects, launching businesses, making aggressive moves, picking fights, surgery (if possible), and pushing too hard for results. This is not the time for bold initiation—it's better for revision and strategy."
  - question: "Can I exercise during Mars retrograde?"
    answer: "Absolutely! Physical activity is actually recommended. Just be more mindful of your body's limits, as injury risk can increase due to impatience or pushing too hard. Listen to your body more carefully."
  - question: "Why does everything feel so frustrating during Mars retrograde?"
    answer: "Mars governs drive, action, and forward momentum. When it's retrograde, that energy turns inward and slows down. What used to flow easily now meets resistance. Your usual strategies don't work. It's like trying to drive with the parking brake on."
  - question: "Does Mars retrograde affect everyone equally?"
    answer: "No. You'll feel it most intensely if Mars is retrograding over planets in your birth chart, or if Mars rules your Sun sign (Aries or Scorpio) or is prominent in your natal chart. Even so, everyone experiences some slowdown in momentum."

Mars is the planet of action, drive, and forward momentum. It's your warrior, your initiator, your get-shit-done energy. So when Mars goes retrograde—turning its force inward and slowing everything down—life can feel like you're trying to sprint through waist-deep mud.

Mars retrograde happens roughly every two years for about 2-2.5 months, and it's one of the most frustrating transits in astrology. Projects stall. Motivation tanks. Conflicts resurface. What used to take one step now takes five, and nothing moves at the pace you want.

But here's the thing: Mars retrograde isn't here to ruin your life. It's here to make you rethink *how* you take action, where you're wasting energy, and what battles are actually worth fighting.

If you've been feeling stuck, irritable, or inexplicably tired during Mars retrograde, you're not broken—you're just living under different cosmic conditions. Let's talk about what's really happening and how to work with it instead of against it.

## What Mars Retrograde Means

When a planet goes retrograde, it appears to move backward from our perspective on Earth. Astrologically, this reverses the planet's energy—instead of expressing outwardly, it turns inward.

Mars normally governs:
- **Action and initiative** – starting things, moving forward
- **Drive and ambition** – motivation, competitive edge
- **Anger and assertion** – how you fight, defend, express frustration
- **Physical energy** – stamina, libido, athleticism
- **Courage and risk-taking** – boldness, taking the lead

During Mars retrograde, all of this goes **internal, slow, and reflective.**

Instead of taking new action, you're reviewing past actions. Instead of moving forward aggressively, you're reconsidering strategy. Instead of external battles, you're wrestling with internal frustration. It's not that Mars energy disappears—it just redirects.

Think of it like this: Mars direct is the accelerator. Mars retrograde is the review mirror. You're not supposed to be speeding ahead right now—you're supposed to be looking at where you've been and deciding if you're on the right road.

## What Mars Retrograde Feels Like (The Frustrations)

Let's be honest: Mars retrograde can feel awful, especially if you're someone who thrives on momentum and progress. Here's what commonly shows up:

**Lack of motivation** – Tasks that used to energize you feel exhausting. Your drive flatlines. You can't summon the fire you usually have.

**Delays and obstacles** – Projects hit unexpected roadblocks. What should take a week takes a month. Progress is slow, frustrating, and full of setbacks.

**Old conflicts resurface** – People, situations, or arguments from the past come back around. Unresolved anger bubbles up. You're forced to deal with what you thought was done.

**Physical fatigue** – Your energy levels drop. Workouts feel harder. You might get sick or injured more easily, especially if you're pushing yourself too hard.

**Passive-aggression and resentment** – Instead of expressing anger directly, it simmers beneath the surface. You (or others) might act out in indirect, petty ways.

**Indecision and second-guessing** – Normally decisive? Not during Mars retrograde. You doubt your choices, rethink your plans, and struggle to commit.

**Sexual energy shifts** – Libido can drop or become inconsistent. What usually feels effortless in intimate connections might require more conscious effort.

**Impatience and irritability** – You're frustrated that nothing's moving at the speed you want. Small annoyances become major irritations.

It's like the universe installed a speed governor on your life. You want to go fast; the cosmos says *slow down.*

## What Mars Retrograde is Actually Asking You to Do

Mars retrograde isn't punishment—it's recalibration. It's asking you to pause, reflect, and refine how you use your energy. Here's what this transit wants from you:

**Review your actions:** Have you been spinning your wheels? Pushing in the wrong direction? Mars retrograde gives you time to assess whether your efforts are actually getting you where you want to go.

**Rethink your strategy:** The approach that worked before might not work now. What needs to change? How can you be smarter, not just harder-working?

**Resolve old anger:** Mars retrograde brings up unfinished business—conflicts you avoided, resentments you buried, boundaries you didn't set. This is your chance to address them, consciously and directly.

**Conserve energy:** You don't have the same reserves during Mars retrograde. Stop pushing so hard. Rest more. Say no more often. Protect your energy like it's precious—because right now, it is.

**Refine your goals:** Are you chasing what you actually want, or what you think you're supposed to want? Mars retrograde strips away performative ambition and reconnects you with genuine desire.

**Practice patience:** This is not the season for instant results. It's the season for slow, steady, behind-the-scenes work. Trust that momentum will return when Mars goes direct.

## What to Avoid During Mars Retrograde

Mars retrograde is notoriously bad timing for certain activities. If you can delay these, do:

**Starting major new projects** – Especially business launches, campaigns, or anything requiring aggressive forward momentum. What you start now will likely stall, require revision, or fizzle out.

**Major purchases (cars, tech, equipment)** – Mars rules machinery and tools. Buying during retrograde increases the likelihood of defects, regret, or needing to return it.

**Elective surgery** – Mars rules cutting, blood, and the body's ability to heal and fight. If surgery can wait, wait. (Obviously, don't delay urgent medical care.)

**Picking fights or making aggressive moves** – Conflicts initiated during Mars retrograde tend to backfire, drag on longer than expected, or reveal you didn't have all the information.

**Pushing yourself physically to extremes** – Injury risk increases when you ignore your body's signals. Mars retrograde asks for mindful movement, not heroic effort.

**Forcing outcomes** – The more you push, the more resistance you'll meet. Mars retrograde rewards patience, not force.

## What to DO During Mars Retrograde

Just because forward momentum is slow doesn't mean this period is wasted. Here's how to use Mars retrograde productively:

**Finish old projects** – This is perfect energy for completing what you started months ago. Tie up loose ends. Polish what's already in motion.

**Revise and refine** – Go back to drafts, plans, or strategies and make them better. Edit, improve, optimize. Mars retrograde loves revision work.

**Address unresolved conflicts** – If there's tension you've been avoiding, now's the time to have that conversation. Mars retrograde brings it to the surface for resolution, not for drama.

**Strategic planning** – You might not be executing right now, but you can plan. Map out your next moves. Research. Build your strategy so you're ready when Mars goes direct.

**Physical reassessment** – Adjust your workout routine, see a physical therapist, rest an old injury, or change your approach to movement. Your body is asking for different treatment right now.

**Anger work** – Journal about what's really pissing you off. Work with a therapist. Practice healthy anger expression. Mars retrograde gives you access to suppressed rage—use it consciously.

**Solo pursuits** – Mars retrograde favors individual work over collaboration. This is your time to focus on personal goals without needing buy-in from others.

## Mars Retrograde Through the Signs (2025-2027)

The sign Mars retrogrades in colors the experience. Here's what to expect based on where Mars is moving backward:

**Mars Retrograde in Cancer** (example) – Emotional action, family conflicts, defending your home/boundaries. Rethinking how you protect yourself and what "safe" means.

**Mars Retrograde in Leo** (example) – Creative blocks, ego battles, leadership struggles. Reassessing how you express confidence and where pride gets in your way.

**Mars Retrograde in Virgo** (example) – Work frustrations, health recalibrations, perfectionism backlash. Refining routines and releasing the need to control every detail.

Check which sign Mars is retrograding in during your current or upcoming retrograde to understand the specific themes at play.

## The Mars Retrograde Timeline

**Pre-Retrograde Shadow** (6-8 weeks before retrograde begins) – You start to feel the slowdown. Themes that will dominate the retrograde begin to emerge. Pay attention—this is your preview.

**Mars Stations Retrograde** – The planet appears to stop in the sky before moving backward. This is the most stagnant, frustrating moment. Energy feels completely stuck.

**Retrograde Period** (~2-2.5 months) – The heart of the transit. Full review, revision, and recalibration mode. Patience is essential.

**Mars Stations Direct** – The planet stops again before resuming forward motion. Relief begins, but it's slow at first.

**Post-Retrograde Shadow** (6-8 weeks after Mars goes direct) – Mars retraces the degrees it retrograded through. You're integrating lessons and starting to move forward again, now with clarity and refined strategy.

Full cycle from start of pre-shadow to end of post-shadow? About **6-7 months.** Mars retrograde is a marathon, not a sprint.

## How to Tell if Mars Retrograde is Hitting You Hard

Not everyone feels Mars retrograde equally. You'll feel it most if:

- **Mars is retrograding over a planet or angle in your birth chart** (especially Sun, Moon, or Rising)
- **You're an Aries or Scorpio** (Mars rules both signs)
- **Mars is prominent in your natal chart** (conjunct your Rising, chart ruler, or heavily aspected)
- **You're naturally high-energy and action-oriented** (Mars retrograde feels like wearing a weighted vest)

If Mars retrograde barely registers for you, count yourself lucky—or lean into the rest and reflection anyway. It's rare cosmic permission to slow down.

## The Gift of Mars Retrograde

Yes, Mars retrograde is frustrating. Yes, it slows you down when you want to speed up. But it also saves you from burning out, heading in the wrong direction, or fighting battles that don't matter.

Mars retrograde teaches you:
- **How to conserve energy** for what actually matters
- **When to act and when to wait** (both are forms of power)
- **How to express anger healthily** instead of suppressing or exploding
- **That rest is productive,** not lazy
- **That slower doesn't mean weaker**—it often means wiser

When Mars goes direct again, you'll be sharper, more strategic, and more focused. The delays were recalibrations. The frustrations were course corrections. The slowdown was necessary.

## Final Thoughts: Don't Fight the Tide

Mars retrograde is like trying to swim upstream. You can do it, but it's exhausting and inefficient. Or you can flip over, float, and let the current take you where you need to go.

Stop fighting the slowdown. Stop forcing what won't move. Stop expecting yourself to operate at full capacity when the cosmic conditions don't support it.

Instead, rest. Reflect. Revise. Resolve. Refine.

And when Mars goes direct again—and it will—you'll be ready to move forward with more clarity, power, and purpose than before.

Mars retrograde isn't the enemy. It's the pause that makes your next move powerful.
