faq:
  - question: "How do I find my Mars sign?"
    answer: "Use a free birth chart calculator at astro.com or cafeastrology.com. You only need your birth date since Mars stays in each sign for about 6-7 weeks. Birth time and location refine the house placement but aren't required for the sign."
  - question: "What does Mars represent in astrology?"
    answer: "Mars represents your drive, ambition, how you take action, express anger, compete, and pursue what you want. It also rules physical energy, sexuality, and how you fight — both literally and metaphorically."
  - question: "Is Mars sign important for compatibility?"
    answer: "Yes, especially for physical chemistry and how you handle conflict. Mars-Mars aspects between charts show if you'll motivate each other or constantly clash. Mars-Venus connections indicate sexual attraction."
  - question: "What's the difference between Mars and Sun sign?"
    answer: "Your Sun sign is your core identity and ego. Your Mars sign is how you take action and go after what you want. A calm Taurus Sun with Mars in Aries will still be surprisingly assertive and quick to act when motivated."
  - question: "Why is my Mars sign different from my Sun sign?"
    answer: "Mars travels independently of the Sun and takes about 2 years to go through all 12 signs. It's common and normal for Mars to be in a completely different sign than your Sun. This creates complexity in your personality."

## Mars Signs: The Drive

### Mars in Aries ♈
**How you fight:** Head-on, immediately, explosively. You say what you think the moment you think it. Conflict doesn't scare you — it energizes you.

**What drives you:** Being first. Winning. Challenge. The possibility of conquest.

**Anger style:** Hot and fast. You explode, say everything, then forget about it in an hour. You don't hold grudges because you don't hold anything.

**In pursuit:** You're direct. You see what you want and go after it. Subtlety is not your thing.

**Shadow:** Aggression. Starting fights you don't need to start. Burning bridges for the thrill of it.

---

### Mars in Taurus ♉
**How you fight:** Slowly, reluctantly, but once you start — you don't stop. You're the immovable object when provoked.

**What drives you:** Security. Comfort. Building something lasting. Sensory pleasure.

**Anger style:** Slow to anger, but when you get there, it's volcanic. You hold on to resentment until it explodes.

## Mars and Sex

Let's address this directly: Mars also rules sexual energy.

Your Mars sign influences:
- How you initiate
- What turns you on
- Your physical energy in bed
- How aggressive or passive you are sexually

Mars in Fire signs (Aries, Leo, Sag) tends toward passionate, enthusiastic, spontaneous sexuality.

Mars in Earth signs (Taurus, Virgo, Cap) tends toward sensual, enduring, physical sexuality.

Mars in Air signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) tends toward mental stimulation, communication, and variety.

Mars in Water signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) tends toward emotional intimacy, intensity, and merging.

---

## Mars Compatibility

Mars compatibility affects how couples fight and pursue goals together.

**Harmonious Mars combinations** (same element) tend to fight similarly and want the same things.

**Challenging Mars combinations** (square or opposite) can create friction — but also heat.

Mars in Fire with Mars in Water can create steam or extinguishing. It depends on awareness.

## Finding Your Mars Sign

Mars stays in each sign for about 6-7 weeks (unless it retrogrades, then longer). You need your birth date to find it.

Look up your birth chart and find the Mars symbol (♂). The sign it's in is your Mars sign.
