faq:
  - question: "How often does Mercury go retrograde?"
    answer: "Mercury goes retrograde 3-4 times per year, lasting about 3 weeks each time. In total, Mercury is retrograde for roughly 20% of the year — it's not rare or unusual."
  - question: "Is Mercury actually moving backward during retrograde?"
    answer: "No, Mercury never actually moves backward. Retrograde is an optical illusion caused by Mercury 'lapping' Earth in its faster orbit around the Sun. It just appears to move backward from our perspective."
  - question: "Should I avoid signing contracts during Mercury retrograde?"
    answer: "The advice to avoid contracts is exaggerated. Just read carefully, double-check details, and allow for flexibility. Many successful deals are signed during retrograde. The key is being thorough, not avoidant."
  - question: "Why do exes come back during Mercury retrograde?"
    answer: "Mercury rules communication and the past. Retrograde periods are associated with revisiting, reviewing, and re-connecting. Whether exes actually appear more often is debatable — you might just notice it more."
  - question: "Does Mercury retrograde affect everyone the same way?"
    answer: "No. It affects you more if Mercury rules your Rising sign (Gemini or Virgo Rising), if you have strong Gemini/Virgo placements, or if retrograde falls in an important house in your chart. Check your natal chart for personal impact."

Every few months, the internet loses its mind about Mercury Retrograde. Texts go wrong. Exes come back. Flights get delayed. Contracts fall through. 

And everyone blames Mercury.

But here's the thing: Mercury Retrograde isn't the cosmic chaos event everyone thinks it is. It's not even actually moving backward. And most of what people blame on it has nothing to do with Mercury at all.

Let's clear this up.

## What "Retrograde" Actually Means

Mercury isn't actually moving backward. No planet ever does.

Retrograde is an optical illusion. It happens because Mercury orbits the Sun faster than Earth does. When Mercury "laps" us, it appears to move backward from our perspective — like when you're in a car passing another car and the slower car seems to move backward relative to you.

That's it. That's the astronomy.

The astrology, however, is more interesting.

## What Mercury Rules

Mercury is the planet of:
- Communication
- Technology
- Travel (especially short trips)
- Contracts and agreements
- Thinking and processing
- Commerce and transactions
- Siblings and neighbors
- Daily logistics

When Mercury goes retrograde, these areas get... weird. Not catastrophic. Just weird.

### Communication Gets Crossed

Messages get misunderstood. Emails go to spam. You say one thing, people hear another. That text you thought was clear? Not so much.

**What to do:** Slow down. Re-read before you send. Assume miscommunication is possible and over-clarify.

### Technology Glitches

Computers crash. Files corrupt. Your phone does something inexplicable. Backups become important.

**What to do:** Back up your data before retrograde starts. Don't buy new electronics during this period if you can help it. Expect glitches and plan for them.

### Travel Goes Sideways

Delays, cancellations, lost luggage, wrong turns. Short trips are more affected than long ones.

**What to do:** Build in extra time. Double-check reservations. Have backup plans.

### Old Things Resurface

Exes text. Old friends reappear. That project you abandoned comes back up. Past issues demand resolution.

**What to do:** This is actually retrograde's gift. It's a chance to revisit, resolve, and close loops. Not everything that returns should stay — but some things deserve a second look.

### Contracts Get Complicated

Not the best time to sign major agreements, start new jobs, or launch new ventures. Not because they'll definitely fail, but because details get missed.

**What to do:** If you must sign, triple-check everything. If you can wait, wait.

## What Mercury Retrograde Is NOT

Let's kill some myths.

### It's Not an Excuse

"Sorry I'm late, Mercury is retrograde" is not a valid excuse. Retrograde might contribute to chaos, but your choices are still your choices.

### It's Not All Bad

Retrograde is great for:
- Revisiting old projects
- Reconnecting with people from your past
- Reviewing and revising work
- Reflecting on decisions
- Researching before committing

Notice a pattern? Everything starts with "re-." That's retrograde's energy — reviewing the past, not charging into the future.

### It's Not Three Weeks of Doom

Mercury goes retrograde 3-4 times a year, for about three weeks each time. If retrograde was truly catastrophic, we'd be in chaos for 25% of the year.

Life goes on during retrograde. People sign contracts, start jobs, travel, and communicate just fine. The energy just asks for more attention.

### It's Not the Only Transit That Matters

There's so much more happening in the sky than Mercury Retrograde. While everyone's panicking about Mercury, Saturn might be squaring your Moon and that's actually what's making your life hard.

Mercury Retrograde gets blamed for a lot of things that have nothing to do with Mercury.

## The Shadow Periods

Here's something most people don't know: retrograde has a warmup and cooldown.

**Pre-Shadow (1-2 weeks before):** Mercury slows down. Themes of the retrograde start emerging. You might notice early communication hiccups.

**Retrograde Proper (3 weeks):** The main event. The energy is strongest.

**Post-Shadow (1-2 weeks after):** Mercury speeds back up but is still covering territory it already crossed. Loose ends get tied up.

So while "retrograde" officially lasts three weeks, the full cycle is more like 6-8 weeks.

## How Mercury Retrograde Affects You Personally

Not everyone experiences retrograde the same way. It depends on your chart.

**If Mercury rules your Rising Sign (Gemini or Virgo Rising)**
You'll feel retrogrades more intensely. This is your ruling planet acting up.

**If retrograde happens in your sign**
That particular retrograde affects you more. Mercury retrograde in Aries? Aries placements feel it.

**If Mercury is prominent in your birth chart**
Strong Mercury aspects, Mercury in the 1st house, Mercury conjunct the Sun — these folks are more sensitive to all Mercury transits.

**If retrograde aspects your natal planets**
When transiting Mercury retrogrades over your natal Venus, for example, relationship communication gets funky.

## Working WITH Retrograde (Not Against It)

The biggest mistake people make is fighting retrograde energy. They try to push forward when the universe is asking them to pause.

Here's how to work with it:

### Use It for Review

That project you abandoned? Revisit it. That relationship you're unsure about? Reflect on it. That decision you've been avoiding? Now's the time to think it through.

Retrograde is excellent for second drafts.

### Slow Your Communication

You don't have to respond immediately. Take time to think. Re-read before sending. Clarify your meaning. Ask if the other person understood.

### Expect the Unexpected

When you expect delays, they don't bother you as much. Build buffer time into everything. Have Plan B ready.

### Let Things Return

When old things come back — people, opportunities, issues — don't immediately reject or accept them. Sit with them. Retrograde is showing you something.

### Avoid If Possible

Not everything can wait, but if you have flexibility:
- Delay major purchases (especially electronics)
- Push back big launches or announcements

## The Bigger Picture

Mercury Retrograde happens 3-4 times a year. It's a regular feature of life on Earth. People have been signing contracts, starting relationships, and traveling during retrograde for all of human history.

It's not a cosmic punishment. It's a reminder to slow down in a culture that never stops accelerating.

Think of it as the universe's way of forcing a review period. Everything's moving so fast — sometimes you need a few weeks where things don't work quite right so you actually stop and pay attention.
