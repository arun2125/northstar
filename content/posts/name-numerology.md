faq:
  - question: "Do I use my married name or birth name for numerology?"
    answer: "Use your full birth name as it appears on your birth certificate for your core numbers (Expression, Soul Urge, Personality). Your married or chosen name creates a new vibration that influences your current expression."
  - question: "What if I go by a nickname—does that affect my numerology?"
    answer: "Yes! Your birth name reveals your core blueprint, but the name you use daily creates your current vibration. Calculate both—your birth name shows your potential; your daily name shows how you're expressing it now."
  - question: "How do I assign numbers to letters?"
    answer: "Use the Pythagorean system: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=5, F=6, G=7, H=8, I=9, J=1, K=2, L=3, M=4, N=5, O=6, P=7, Q=8, R=9, S=1, T=2, U=3, V=4, W=5, X=6, Y=7, Z=8. Numbers repeat every nine letters."
  - question: "Is name numerology as important as Life Path Number?"
    answer: "Both are crucial! Life Path (from birthdate) shows your journey and purpose. Expression Number (from name) shows how you express yourself and interact with the world. Think of Life Path as your destination and Expression as your vehicle."
  - question: "Can changing my name change my destiny?"
    answer: "Changing your name changes your vibration and how you express yourself, which can absolutely shift your life path. Many people adopt new names during major transformations. However, your birth name's energy remains your core blueprint."

You've probably explored your [Life Path Number](/blog/life-path-number)—the numerological blueprint from your birthdate. But there's another powerful code hidden in plain sight: **your name**.

The name you were given at birth isn't random. It carries specific vibrations that reveal how you express yourself in the world, what your soul truly desires, and how others perceive you. While your birthdate shows your life's purpose, your name shows your tools, talents, and the mask you wear.

Name numerology unlocks three essential numbers:
- **Expression Number:** Who you are and how you express yourself
- **Soul Urge Number:** What you deeply desire and need
- **Personality Number:** How others see you before they know you

Let's explore how to calculate these numbers and what they reveal about your authentic self.

## The Three Core Name Numbers

Your name contains multiple layers of meaning, each revealing a different [aspect](/glossary#A) of your identity:

**Expression Number (Destiny Number):** Calculated from ALL letters in your full birth name. This reveals your natural talents, abilities, and how you express yourself in the world. It's your destiny in terms of what you're naturally equipped to do.

**Soul Urge Number (Heart's Desire):** Calculated from the VOWELS in your name (A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y). This reveals your deepest motivations, desires, and what truly makes you feel fulfilled. It's your inner self—what your soul craves.

**Personality Number:** Calculated from the CONSONANTS in your name. This reveals how others perceive you upon first meeting, before they know your inner self. It's your outer shell or social mask.

Together, these three numbers create a complete picture of your identity: who you are (Expression), what you want (Soul Urge), and how you appear (Personality).

Think of it astrologically: your Expression Number is like your [Sun sign](/blog/sun-sign-guide) (core identity), your Soul Urge is like your [Moon sign](/blog/moon-signs-emotions) (emotional needs), and your Personality Number is like your [Rising sign](/blog/rising-sign-guide) (outer presentation).

## How to Calculate Your Name Numbers

### The Pythagorean System

Numerology uses a simple letter-to-number conversion:

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I |
| J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R |
| S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z |   |

Each letter equals a number from 1-9. The pattern repeats every nine letters.

### Step-by-Step Calculation

Let's use the name **SARAH JANE MILLER** as an example:

**Step 1: Write out the full birth name**

```
S A R A H   J A N E   M I L L E R
```

**Step 2: Assign numbers to each letter**

```
S=1  A=1  R=9  A=1  H=8     J=1  A=1  N=5  E=5     M=4  I=9  L=3  L=3  E=5  R=9
```

**Step 3: Calculate Expression Number (all letters)**

```
1+1+9+1+8 + 1+1+5+5 + 4+9+3+3+5+9 = 65
6+5 = 11 (Master Number!)
1+1 = 2
```

**Expression Number: 11/2** (keep master numbers; also read the reduced version)

**Step 4: Calculate Soul Urge Number (vowels only)**

```
Vowels: A A A E I E E
        1+1+1+5+9+5+5 = 27
        2+7 = 9
```

**Soul Urge Number: 9**

**Step 5: Calculate Personality Number (consonants only)**

```
Consonants: S R H J N M L L R
            1+9+8+1+5+4+3+3+9 = 43
            4+3 = 7
```

**Personality Number: 7**

**Important notes:**
- Use your FULL birth name as it appears on your birth certificate
- Include middle names
- Master numbers (11, 22, 33) are NOT reduced—keep them as double digits
- Y is a vowel if it sounds like one (Kyle = Y is vowel; Yolanda = Y is consonant)
- Don't reduce 11, 22, or 33 until the very end

## Personality Number: Your Social Mask

Your Personality Number reveals how others perceive you before they truly know you. This is your **outer shell**—the first impression you make and the energy you project socially.

This number can be quite different from your Expression or Soul Urge, creating an interesting dynamic. You might be a Soul Urge 2 (craving connection) with Personality 7 (appearing aloof), creating a situation where people don't initially realize how much you want connection.

### Personality 1: Appears Confident and Independent

**First impression:** Strong, confident, capable, independent, possibly intimidating

**People perceive you as:** A leader who knows what they want and doesn't need anyone

**Potential gap:** If you're actually a Soul Urge 2 or 6, your confident exterior might hide your relationship needs.

### Personality 2: Appears Gentle and Approachable

**First impression:** Friendly, warm, easy to talk to, diplomatic, non-threatening

**People perceive you as:** Kind, supportive, good listener, cooperative

**Potential gap:** If you're an Expression 1 or 8, your gentle exterior might hide your leadership capabilities.

### Personality 3: Appears Charismatic and Fun

**First impression:** Entertaining, creative, optimistic, fun to be around, charming

**People perceive you as:** The life of the party, creative, lighthearted

**Potential gap:** If you're a Soul Urge 7, your fun exterior might hide your depth and spiritual seeking.

**People perceive you as:** The responsible one, organized, maybe a bit serious

## Using Your Name Numbers Together

The real power comes from understanding all three numbers together:

**Expression + Soul Urge + Personality = Complete Self-Understanding**

**Example 1:**
- Expression 1 (natural leader)
- Soul Urge 2 (craves connection)
- Personality 8 (appears powerful)

**Interpretation:** You're a natural leader who appears very powerful and successful, but secretly what you most want is deep connection and partnership. Your challenge is letting your guard down to reveal your relationship needs.

**Example 2:**
- Expression 7 (natural seeker)
- Soul Urge 9 (wants to serve humanity)
- Personality 3 (appears fun and social)

**Interpretation:** You're a deep spiritual seeker who wants to help humanity, but people initially see you as lighthearted and social. Your challenge is revealing your depth to people who expect surface fun.

**Example 3:**
- Expression 4 (natural builder)
- Soul Urge 5 (craves freedom)
- Personality 6 (appears responsible)

**Interpretation:** You have strong building abilities and appear very responsible, but internally you crave freedom and adventure. Your challenge is balancing your need for structure with your desire for variety.

Understanding these dynamics helps you understand internal conflicts and work with them rather than against them.

## Changing Your Name, Changing Your Energy

When you change your name (through marriage, adoption, or personal choice), you create a new vibration that influences how you express yourself currently. Your birth name remains your core blueprint, but your current name shows how you're operating now.

Many people instinctively change their names during major life transformations because they feel the old name no longer fits. This isn't random—you're aligning your outer identity (name) with your inner transformation.

**Calculate both:** Your birth name shows your potential and core self. Your current name shows how you're expressing yourself now and what energy you're working with daily.

For deeper insight into how names and identity interact with celestial patterns, explore your [birth chart](/blog/birth-chart-basics) alongside your name numerology. Together they create a complete picture of identity and purpose.

## Name Numerology and Astrology: The Complete Picture

Your name numbers and [astrological placements](/blog/birth-chart-basics) work together:

- **Expression Number = Sun Sign:** Core identity and natural expression
- **Soul Urge Number = Moon Sign:** Emotional needs and desires
- **Personality Number = Rising Sign:** Outer presentation and first impression

When your numerology and astrology align (Expression 1 with Aries Sun, for example), you have consistent, focused energy. When they differ (Expression 2 with Aries Sun), you have interesting tensions to navigate and integrate.

Use both systems for complete self-knowledge. Numerology reveals the essence; astrology reveals the timing and specific life areas where that essence plays out.

Calculate your Expression, Soul Urge, and Personality Numbers today. Then reflect: Where do they align? Where do they create interesting tensions? How can you honor all aspects of yourself—what you naturally express, what you deeply desire, and how you appear to others?

Your name isn't random—it's a code containing the keys to your authentic self. Now you know how to read it.
