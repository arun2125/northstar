faq:
  - question: "What's the best time to set New Moon intentions?"
    answer: "The most potent window is from the exact New Moon to 48 hours after. However, the entire waxing phase (New Moon to Full Moon, about 14 days) supports intention-setting and forward momentum."
  - question: "How many intentions should I set at each New Moon?"
    answer: "Quality over quantity. Focus on 1-3 clear, meaningful intentions rather than a long wish list. This keeps your energy focused and your intentions realistic."
  - question: "Do I need to do a ritual or can I just write them down?"
    answer: "Writing them down is the minimum—and it works! Rituals add energetic power through focused intention, but simple is often better. What matters most is clarity and feeling connected to your intentions."
  - question: "What if I miss the exact New Moon timing?"
    answer: "You haven't missed it. The entire week after the New Moon is still great for setting intentions. The Moon is still waxing (growing), which supports beginnings and building energy."
  - question: "Should my intentions match the New Moon's zodiac sign?"
    answer: "It helps! Each New Moon occurs in a different sign, bringing specific themes. Aligning your intentions with that sign's energy gives them extra cosmic support. But if something urgent needs attention, go with what feels right for you."

Every month, like clockwork, the Moon resets. It disappears from the sky, goes dark, and begins again. This is the New Moon—a cosmic blank slate, a moment of pure potential. And if you've been on spiritual or manifestation corners of the internet, you've definitely heard about setting New Moon intentions.

But here's what most guides get wrong: New Moon intention-setting isn't about wishing on a cosmic genie. It's not about demanding the universe deliver your dream life in two weeks. It's about aligning your will with natural cycles, planting seeds intentionally, and then doing the work to help them grow.

Let's talk about how to actually set New Moon intentions in a way that works—grounded, practical, and backed by lunar wisdom.

## Why the New Moon Matters for Intentions

The Moon's cycle mirrors the rhythm of growth in nature. Seeds planted in darkness push through soil. Projects begun quietly build momentum over time. The New Moon is that fertile void—the moment before the first sprout breaks through.

Energetically, the New Moon represents **new beginnings, fresh starts, and initiation.** It's the inhale before the exhale, the pause before the action. When you set intentions at the New Moon, you're working with that initiating energy rather than against it.

Think of it this way: trying to start something new at the Full Moon (when energy is about culmination and release) is like planting seeds during harvest season. It's not impossible, but you're swimming upstream. The New Moon gives you the current in your favor.

Astrologically, each New Moon happens in a different zodiac sign, bringing specific themes and flavors to that month's reset. A New Moon in fiery Aries supports bold action and independence. A New Moon in nurturing Cancer invites intentions around home and emotional security. Aligning your intentions with the sign's energy amplifies their potency.

## The Difference Between Wishes and Intentions

Here's where most people go wrong: they treat New Moon intentions like vision boards—vague desires for things to magically appear. "I want more money." "I want true love." "I want to be happy."

That's not an intention. That's a wish.

**An intention is specific, actionable, and rooted in your agency.** It's not about what you want the universe to do for you—it's about what you're committing to grow, cultivate, or shift in your own life.

Instead of "I want more money," try: "I intend to apply for three higher-paying positions this month and have an honest conversation with my boss about a raise."

Instead of "I want true love," try: "I intend to show up authentically on dates and communicate my needs clearly in my relationships."

See the difference? Intentions put you in the driver's seat. They're collaborative with the universe, not passive. You're saying, "This is what I'm planting. I'll tend it. I trust the conditions will support its growth."

The universe can't do your work for you, but it absolutely will meet you halfway when you're clear and committed.

**Step 1: Check the New Moon's Sign and House**

Look up where the New Moon is happening this month. What sign? What house in your [birth chart](/glossary#B) (if you know it)? This tells you what themes are being activated. For example:

- New Moon in **Taurus** = intentions around stability, finances, pleasure, values
- New Moon in **Gemini** = intentions around communication, learning, connections
- New Moon in your **7th house** = intentions around partnerships and relationships
- New Moon in your **10th house** = intentions around career and public life

Aligning your intentions with these themes gives them natural support.

**Step 2: Get Clear on What You Actually Want**

Before you write anything, sit in stillness. Meditate, journal, or simply ask yourself: *What wants to begin? What area of my life is asking for attention?*

Don't force it. Don't pick something because it sounds impressive or because you think you "should" want it. Feel into what's genuinely calling you. Sometimes it's big (career change, relationship shift). Sometimes it's small (drink more water, read before bed). Both are valid.

The key is that it resonates with you on a gut level, not just a mental level.

**Step 3: Write Your Intentions in Present or Future Tense**

There's power in language. Write your intentions as if they're already unfolding or as clear future commitments.

Examples:
- "I am creating space in my schedule for rest and creative play."
- "I will have a vulnerable conversation with my partner about our future."
- "I am building a morning routine that supports my mental health."

Keep them **positive** (what you want, not what you don't want) and **specific** (clear actions or outcomes, not vague hopes).

Aim for 1-3 intentions. More than that and you dilute your focus.

**Step 4: Feel Into Them**

This step is underrated but crucial. After you write your intentions, close your eyes and feel what it would be like if they came to fruition. How would your life feel different? What would shift in your energy, your daily experience, your sense of self?

This isn't "manifesting" in the woo-woo sense—it's priming your nervous system to recognize and move toward what you're calling in. You're creating an energetic blueprint.

**Step 5: Take One Aligned Action**

Intentions without action are just pretty words. Within the first week of the New Moon (ideally within 48 hours), take **one concrete step** toward each intention.

Intending to prioritize rest? Block out time in your calendar. Intending to improve your relationship? Send the text to set up that conversation. Intending to build healthier habits? Buy the vegetables, set the alarm, download the app.

This signals to both your subconscious and the universe: *I'm serious. I'm in.*

## What to Do During the Waxing Moon Phase

The two weeks between New Moon and Full Moon are your **building period.** The Moon is growing in light, and so is your intention. This is the time to:

- **Stay consistent** with actions that support your intentions
- **Notice opportunities** that align with what you're calling in
- **Adjust course** if needed—intentions aren't rigid contracts; they can evolve
- **Track progress** in a journal or notes app so you can see what's working

This phase is active. You're nurturing the seeds you planted. You're showing up. You're doing the work.

At the Full Moon, you'll get a checkpoint: What's come to light? What's ready to release? What needs to shift? But we'll save that for another post.

## Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

**Mistake #1: Setting too many intentions.** Your energy gets scattered. Pick what truly matters and give it your full focus.

**Mistake #2: Being too vague.** "I want to be healthier" doesn't tell your brain or the universe what to actually do. Get specific: what does healthier look like? What actions will you take?

**Mistake #3: Forgetting about them.** You set intentions, feel inspired for two days, then forget they exist. Write them somewhere visible. Review them weekly. Keep them alive in your awareness.

**Mistake #4: Treating them like magic spells.** The New Moon doesn't grant wishes. It supports your efforts. You still have to do the thing.

**Mistake #5: Ignoring the lunar sign.** Setting career intentions during a Cancer New Moon (which is about home and feelings) isn't wrong, but it's less supported. Work with the cosmic weather, not against it.

## The Long Game: Tracking Your Lunar Intentions

Here's where it gets really interesting. After 3-6 months of setting New Moon intentions, you'll start to notice patterns. Certain themes keep coming up. Certain areas of life are clearly asking for attention. Some intentions manifest quickly; others take multiple cycles.

This is valuable information. It shows you where you're resisting growth, where you're aligned, and what your soul is genuinely asking for versus what your ego thinks you should want.

Keep a running document or journal of your New Moon intentions. Review them at the Full Moon (two weeks later) and again at the next New Moon. Celebrate what's grown. Release what didn't resonate. Recommit to what still matters.

Over time, you'll develop a relationship with the lunar cycle. You'll feel when the New Moon is approaching because your energy shifts. You'll instinctively know what wants to begin. You'll trust the rhythm.

## New Moon Intention-Setting is a Practice, Not Perfection

You don't need candles, crystals, or a perfectly curated ritual (though if those things help you feel connected, use them). You don't need to wait for the "perfect" New Moon or beat yourself up if you miss one.

What you need is consistency, clarity, and commitment. Show up each month. Plant your seeds. Tend them. Trust the cycle.

The Moon will reset every 29.5 days whether you set intentions or not. The question is: will you use that rhythm intentionally, or let it pass you by?

New Moon intentions are simply a way of saying, "I'm awake. I'm participating. I'm choosing what I want to grow in my life." And that's the real magic—not in the Moon, but in your conscious collaboration with the cycles that govern all of life.

So next New Moon, grab a pen. Get clear. Write it down. Take one step. And watch what grows.
