faq:
  - question: "What's the difference between transits and progressions?"
    answer: "Transits are external—the planets moving through the sky and affecting your chart. Progressions are internal—showing how you evolve from within. Transits bring events; progressions change who you are. Both are valid timing tools that work together."
  - question: "How often should I check my progressed chart?"
    answer: "Progressions move slowly, so you don't need to check daily or even monthly. Review your progressed chart once a year, or when you feel a significant internal shift. Major progressed aspects (like a progressed new moon) are worth tracking."
  - question: "Can progressions override my natal chart?"
    answer: "No, your natal chart is always your foundation. Progressions modify and develop the natal chart but never replace it. Think of the natal chart as who you were born to be; progressions show who you're becoming within that framework."
  - question: "What if my progressed Sun changes signs?"
    answer: "This is a major life transition, happening roughly every 30 years. Your core identity shifts—you might feel like a different person, with new interests, values, and self-expression. It's profound but gradual, not sudden."
  - question: "Do I need to know astrology well to use progressions?"
    answer: "A basic understanding of planets, signs, and aspects helps tremendously. If you can read your natal chart, you can learn progressions. If you're brand new to astrology, master the natal chart first, then add progressions as an advanced tool."

## What Are Secondary Progressions?

Here's a wild idea that actually works: what if the first 90 days of your life symbolically represented the first 90 *years*? What if each day after your birth corresponded to a year of your life?

That's secondary progressions—astrology's "day for a year" technique. The planets' positions on day 30 of your life show the themes of your year 30. Day 45 = year 45. And so on.

It sounds arbitrary, but this technique has been used for centuries because it works uncannily well. Progressions reveal your internal evolution—how you grow, mature, and change from the inside out. While [transits](/glossary#T) bring external events and circumstances, progressions show who you're becoming.

Think of it this way: transits are the weather. Progressions are climate change. Weather affects your day; climate affects your life. A transit might bring a difficult week or month. A progression shifts who you are across years or decades.

Understanding progressions gives you a map of your psychological and spiritual development. You can see when major internal shifts are coming, what areas of life are evolving, and how your identity itself is maturing over time.

## The Day-for-a-Year Method

The calculation is straightforward:

1. Start with your birth date
2. Each day after birth = one year of life
3. The planets' positions on that day become your "progressed" planets

**Example:** If you were born on January 1, 2000:
- Your progressed chart for age 25 (year 2025) uses the planetary positions from January 26, 2000 (25 days after birth)
- Your progressed chart for age 30 uses January 31, 2000
- And so on

You don't have to calculate this manually—any astrology software or website can generate your progressed chart. But understanding the logic helps you grasp why progressions move so slowly: a planet that moves 1° per day in real time moves only 1° per *year* in progressions.

## The Key Players in Progressions

Not all progressed planets matter equally. The most significant are:

### Progressed Sun

The progressed Sun moves about 1° per year, changing signs roughly every 30 years. When your progressed Sun changes signs, your core identity shifts. You're entering a new chapter of self-expression.

**Example:** Someone born with Sun in Virgo might have their progressed Sun enter Libra in their 20s. Suddenly, themes of partnership, balance, and beauty become central to their identity—even though their natal Sun is still in service-oriented Virgo.

Watch for:
- Progressed Sun changing signs (major identity shift)
- Progressed Sun aspecting natal planets (activating natal potential)
- Progressed Sun conjunct an angle (IC, DC, MC, ASC)

### Progressed Moon

The progressed Moon is the fastest-moving progressed body, changing signs roughly every 2.5 years and completing a full cycle through all 12 signs in about 27-29 years. The progressed Moon shows where your emotional focus is, what you need, and what themes are emotionally prominent.

When your progressed Moon moves into a new sign, your emotional landscape shifts. The sign it's transiting colors your feelings and needs for the next 2.5 years.

**Progressed Moon through the signs:**
- **Aries:** Need for independence, new emotional beginnings
- **Taurus:** Need for stability, emotional security
- **Gemini:** Need for communication, emotional variety
- **Cancer:** Need for nurturing, emotional depth
- **Leo:** Need for recognition, emotional expression
- **Virgo:** Need for improvement, emotional refinement
- **Libra:** Need for partnership, emotional harmony
- **Scorpio:** Need for intensity, emotional transformation
- **Sagittarius:** Need for freedom, emotional expansion
- **Capricorn:** Need for achievement, emotional maturity
- **Aquarius:** Need for independence, emotional detachment
- **Pisces:** Need for transcendence, emotional dissolution

### Progressed Lunar Phase

Just as the natal moon phase you were born under matters, the current progressed lunar phase matters too. The progressed Moon's relationship to the progressed Sun creates a 29-year cycle of phases:

**Progressed New Moon:** Major new beginning every ~29 years. Plant seeds for the next 29-year cycle. Often coincides with significant life changes.

**Progressed First Quarter:** About 7 years after the new moon. Crisis of action—taking decisive steps, overcoming obstacles.

**Progressed Full Moon:** About 14-15 years after the new moon. Culmination, realization, bringing something to fruition. High visibility and clarity.

**Progressed Last Quarter:** About 22 years after the new moon. Release, letting go, preparing for the next cycle.

### Progressed Mercury, Venus, and Mars

These personal planets can change signs and form aspects in the progressed chart:

**Progressed Mercury:** How your thinking and communication style evolves. When it changes signs, your mental focus shifts.

**Progressed Venus:** How your values, aesthetics, and relationship style evolve. Sign changes shift what you find beautiful and valuable.

**Progressed Mars:** How your drive, assertion, and action style evolve. Sign changes shift how you pursue goals.

### Outer Planet Progressions

The outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) move too slowly to significantly change position in progressions. However, they can:
- Station direct or retrograde in the progressed chart
- Be aspected by faster-moving progressed planets

A progressed planet stationing—changing direction—marks a significant shift in how you experience that planet's energy.

## Major Progressed Events

Certain progressed configurations are especially significant:

### Progressed New Moon

Every 29-30 years, the progressed Sun and Moon conjoin. This is a progressed new moon—one of the most significant events in a progressed chart. It marks the beginning of a new 29-year cycle, often accompanied by major life changes, new beginnings, or a complete reorientation of identity.

Look at the house where the progressed new moon falls—that's where the new cycle is being seeded.

### Progressed Full Moon

The opposite—progressed Sun and Moon in opposition. Occurring about 14-15 years after a progressed new moon, this is culmination time. What you seeded reaches fruition. There's illumination, clarity, and often a sense of "arriving." Goals may be achieved. Truths may be revealed.

### Progressed Sun Changing Signs

This happens only 3-4 times in a lifetime. It marks a fundamental shift in how you express your core self. The transition can take 1-2 years to fully integrate and often coincides with significant life changes.

### Progressed Planets Conjunct Angles

When a progressed planet reaches an angle (Ascendant, IC, Descendant, Midheaven), that planet's themes become prominent:

- **Conjunct Ascendant:** New identity or way of presenting yourself
- **Conjunct IC:** Changes at home, family, or inner foundation
- **Conjunct Descendant:** Significant relationships or partnership themes
- **Conjunct Midheaven:** Career developments, public recognition, life direction

## Progressions + Transits = Full Picture

Progressions and transits work together. Neither tells the whole story alone.

**Progressions show internal readiness.** You might have transiting Jupiter conjunct your Midheaven (excellent for career), but if your progressions don't support career focus, the transit may not fully activate.

**Transits trigger progressed themes.** A major progressed configuration often "activates" when a transit hits it. The progression sets the stage; the transit cues the action.

**Example:** Someone with progressed Sun entering their 10th house (career focus) might not see external career changes until transiting Saturn conjuncts their Midheaven. The progression created internal readiness; the transit brought external manifestation.

Professional astrologers always consider both. Learning to integrate them takes practice, but even basic awareness improves timing predictions dramatically.

## How to Read Your Progressed Chart

**Step 1:** Generate your progressed chart for the current date. Most astrology websites and apps offer this feature.

**Step 2:** Note the sign positions of progressed Sun and Moon. Compare to your natal positions—how have they shifted?

**Step 3:** Check the progressed lunar phase. Where are you in your 29-year Sun-Moon cycle?

**Step 4:** Look for progressed planets aspecting natal planets or angles. These are active developmental areas.

**Step 5:** Note any progressed sign changes or stations happening now or soon.

**Step 6:** Consider transits to your progressed chart. A transit hitting both natal and progressed positions is particularly potent.

## Practical Applications

### Life Planning

Progressions help you plan major life decisions. If a progressed new moon is approaching, it might not be the time for a total career change—you're closing a cycle, not starting one. Wait for the new moon and plant fresh seeds.

### Understanding Transitions

Feeling like a different person than you were five years ago? Your progressed chart likely shifted. The changed signs or houses explain the internal evolution you've experienced.

### Relationship Timing

Progressions involving the 7th house, progressed Venus, or aspects between progressed charts of partners reveal relationship evolution. Some relationships thrive during certain progressions and struggle during others.

### Career Insights

Progressed planets entering the 10th house, aspecting the Midheaven, or the progressed Sun entering ambitious signs all relate to career evolution.

## A Note on Interpretation

Progressions are subtle. They don't bring sudden events—they shift who you are over time. Think of them as a slow tide rather than a wave. You might not notice a progressed shift until you look back and realize you've changed.

This subtlety is both the strength and challenge of progressions. They require patience and self-awareness to track. But once you learn to read them, you have a map of your own evolution—past, present, and future.
