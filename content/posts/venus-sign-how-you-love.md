faq:
  - question: "How do I find my Venus sign?"
    answer: "Use a free birth chart calculator at astro.com or cafeastrology.com with your birth date, time, and location. Venus stays in each sign for about 3-4 weeks, so you only need your birth date for this one — birth time is optional."
  - question: "What's the difference between Sun sign and Venus sign in love?"
    answer: "Your Sun sign is your core identity, while your Venus sign is specifically how you love and what you're attracted to. Someone can be a fiery Aries Sun but have gentle Venus in Pisces, making them a romantic softie in relationships."
  - question: "Is Venus sign compatibility important?"
    answer: "Yes! Venus sign compatibility often matters more than Sun sign compatibility for romantic relationships. Look for harmonious aspects between your Venus and your partner's Venus, Moon, or Mars for natural chemistry."
  - question: "Can my Venus sign be different from my Sun sign?"
    answer: "Yes, very commonly. Venus can only be within two signs of your Sun (the same sign, one sign before, or one sign after). So a Scorpio Sun could have Venus in Libra, Scorpio, or Sagittarius — but never Venus in Aries."
  - question: "What if my Venus sign is in a sign I don't like?"
    answer: "Every Venus placement has strengths. Venus in 'difficult' signs like Aries or Scorpio just means you love intensely and need passion. Understanding your Venus helps you embrace your authentic romantic style instead of fighting it."

Your Sun sign is who you are. Your Moon sign is how you feel. But your Venus sign? That's how you love.

Venus governs:
- What you find attractive
- How you show love
- What you need to feel loved
- Your aesthetic preferences
- Your relationship with money and pleasure
- What makes you feel beautiful

If you've ever wondered why you fall for the same type over and over, or why your love language doesn't match your partner's, Venus probably has the answer.

## Venus and Money

Venus doesn't just rule love — it rules value, pleasure, and money too.

Your Venus sign influences:
- How you spend money
- What you splurge on
- Your relationship with luxury
- What you find beautiful and worth investing in

Venus in Taurus? You probably splurge on comfort and quality. Venus in Gemini? Books, gadgets, experiences. Venus in Leo? Anything that makes you look good.

## When Venus Signs Clash

Two people with compatible Venus signs often have harmonious relationships. Conflicting Venus signs create friction.

**Fire Venus (Aries, Leo, Sag)** wants excitement and independence.
**Earth Venus (Taurus, Virgo, Cap)** wants stability and security.
**Air Venus (Gemini, Libra, Aqua)** wants intellectual connection and space.
**Water Venus (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces)** wants emotional depth and intimacy.

Fire + Air usually works. Earth + Water usually works. Fire + Water can be steam or extinguishing. Earth + Air can be grounding or suffocating.

But any combination can work with awareness.

## Finding Your Venus Sign

Venus stays in each sign for about 3-4 weeks, so you need your birth date (not time) to find it.

Look up your birth chart and find the Venus symbol (♀). The sign it's in is your Venus sign.
