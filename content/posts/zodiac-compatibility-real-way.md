faq:
  - question: "Is Sun sign compatibility accurate?"
    answer: "Sun sign compatibility is a starting point but very incomplete. Real compatibility (synastry) compares entire birth charts — especially Moon, Venus, and Mars placements. Two 'incompatible' Sun signs can have amazing chemistry through other placements."
  - question: "What planets matter most for relationship compatibility?"
    answer: "Moon signs for emotional compatibility and feeling 'at home' together. Venus signs for love style and what you value. Mars signs for physical chemistry and how you handle conflict. The aspects between these planets matter more than the signs alone."
  - question: "Can incompatible signs have good relationships?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Sun sign compatibility charts are oversimplified. A Taurus and Sagittarius might clash on paper but have harmonious Moon signs that create deep emotional understanding. Look at the full synastry chart, not just Sun signs."
  - question: "What is synastry in astrology?"
    answer: "Synastry is the comparison of two birth charts to assess relationship compatibility. Astrologers look at how planets in one chart aspect (connect to) planets in the other chart. It reveals chemistry, challenges, and growth potential between two people."
  - question: "What's the worst aspect for compatibility?"
    answer: "There's no single 'worst' aspect — it depends on the planets involved. Mars square Mars can create conflict but also passion. Saturn aspects can feel limiting but provide stability. Even challenging aspects can work with awareness and effort."

You've seen the articles. "Are Aries and Libra compatible?" "Best matches for Scorpio."

And they're not useless. But they're also barely scratching the surface.

Real astrological compatibility is called synastry, and it looks at how two entire birth charts interact — not just Sun signs.

Here's how it actually works.

## Why Sun Sign Compatibility Is Limited

When someone says "Taurus and Cancer are compatible," they're only looking at one planet in each chart.

But you have 10 planets. So does your partner. That's 100+ potential connections between your charts.

Your Sun signs might clash, but your Moon signs might be perfect. Your Venus signs might harmonize beautifully while your Mars signs create constant friction.

Sun sign compatibility is one piece of a very complex puzzle.

## What Actually Matters in Compatibility

### 1. [moon sign](/glossary#M) Compatibility

If Sun is who you are, [Moon is who you live with](/blog/moon-sign-meaning) every day. Moon sign compatibility might matter more than Sun sign compatibility for long-term relationships.

**Moon in the same element** (Fire-Fire, Earth-Earth, Air-Air, Water-Water) usually means you process emotions similarly. You get each other's needs.

**Moon in compatible [elements](/glossary#E)** (Fire-Air, Earth-Water) also works well. Fire and Air stimulate each other; Earth and Water nurture each other.

**Moon in challenging elements** (Fire-Water, Earth-Air) creates friction. Not impossible — just requires work.

### 2. Venus Sign Compatibility

[Venus is how you love](/blog/venus-sign-how-you-love). Two people with compatible Venus signs often have similar love languages.

Venus in the same sign? You want the same things romantically.

Venus in the same element? You have compatible relationship styles.

Venus square Venus? Friction in what you value, need, and express.

### 3. Mars Sign Compatibility

Mars is desire, action, and sex drive. Mars compatibility affects how you pursue each other and how you fight.

Mars in the same or compatible signs: Similar energy levels, sexual compatibility, fighting styles that match.

Mars in challenging signs: Different energy levels, potential sexual frustration, fighting styles that clash.

### 4. Mercury Sign Compatibility

Mercury is communication. If your Mercury signs don't connect, you'll struggle to understand each other.

Mercury in the same element usually communicates well. Mercury in challenging aspects can mean constant misunderstandings.

In synastry, astrologers look at how planets from one chart aspect (connect to) planets in the other chart.

### Conjunctions (0°)
Planets in the same sign fuse their energy. Powerful for both good and difficult connections.

- Sun conjunct Moon: Strong attraction, complementary energies
- Venus conjunct Mars: Intense attraction, passion
- Saturn conjunct Sun: Can feel heavy or stabilizing

### Trines (120°)
Easy, harmonious flow between planets. Natural compatibility.

- Moon trine Moon: Emotional understanding without effort
- Venus trine Venus: Easy romantic compatibility
- Sun trine Sun: Natural mutual respect

### Squares (90°)
Tension, friction, challenge. Not dealbreakers — often create attraction — but require work.

- Moon square Moon: Different emotional needs
- Venus square Mars: Attraction with frustration
- Mercury square Mercury: Communication struggles

### Oppositions (180°)
Push-pull dynamic. Can be magnetic attraction or constant conflict.

- Sun opposite Moon: Classic attraction (masculine/feminine polarity)
- Venus opposite Venus: Different but complementary love styles
- Mars opposite Mars: Either competitive or complementary

## The Connections That Make Relationships

### Sun-Moon Connections
When someone's Sun aspects your Moon (or vice versa), there's a natural fit. The Sun person feels seen; the Moon person feels supported.

This is one of the most important connections for long-term compatibility.

### Venus-Mars Connections
Venus-Mars aspects between charts indicate attraction and sexual chemistry.

- Venus conjunct Mars: Intense mutual attraction
- Venus trine Mars: Easy, natural chemistry
- Venus square Mars: Attraction with tension (hot but complicated)

### Personal Planets to Personal Planets
Personal planets are Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars. When multiple personal planets connect between charts, there's a strong sense of familiarity.

Few or no personal planet connections? You might feel like strangers, even if you're compatible on paper.

---

## Red Flags in Synastry

### Saturn Conjunct Personal Planets
Saturn can stabilize a relationship or make it feel like a burden. Saturn conjunct someone's Sun, Moon, or Venus can feel limiting or critical.

It's not always bad — mature relationships often have Saturn connections — but it requires awareness.

### Neptune Conjunct Personal Planets
Neptune creates idealization and illusion. When someone's Neptune conjuncts your Venus, you might fall in love with who you imagine them to be, not who they are.

Reality eventually intrudes.

### Pluto Conjunct Personal Planets
Pluto connections are intense and transformative. They can be deeply bonding or deeply destructive.

Pluto conjunct Venus? Obsessive love. Pluto conjunct Moon? Emotional intensity that changes you.

These aren't dealbreakers, but they require conscious handling.

---

## House Overlays

Where do someone's planets fall in your chart?

If their Sun falls in your 7th house (partnership), they naturally fit your partnership needs. If their Venus falls in your 5th house (romance), the romantic energy is emphasized.

House overlays show what role someone plays in your life, beyond just compatibility.

## What Nobody Tells You About Compatibility

### 1. Perfect Compatibility Doesn't Exist

Every chart combination has strengths and challenges. Looking for a "perfect match" misses the point.

Good relationships aren't about perfect compatibility. They're about two people willing to work with what they have.

### 2. Challenging Aspects Create Growth

Easy aspects feel nice but can become boring. Squares and oppositions create friction — which also creates passion and growth.

Some of the most powerful relationships have significant challenges in the synastry. The question is whether both people are willing to grow.

### 3. Charts Don't Determine Destiny

Two people with "incompatible" charts can have beautiful relationships through awareness and effort. Two people with "perfect" synastry can still hurt each other.

Astrology shows tendencies and patterns. It doesn't determine outcomes. Free will matters.

### 4. Individual Charts Matter More

Before synastry, look at each person's natal chart.

Is someone capable of relationship? Do they have patterns of sabotage? What are their growth edges?

A difficult natal chart can override even the best synastry.

## How to Actually Check Compatibility

1. **Get both birth charts** (with birth times if possible)
2. **Look at Moon sign compatibility** first — it matters most for daily life
3. **Check Venus and Mars** for love style and attraction
4. **Look for major aspects** between personal planets
5. **Notice house overlays** for role dynamics
6. **Consider Saturn, Neptune, and Pluto** contacts for depth and challenges
7. **Remember:** No combination is hopeless, none is perfect

## Beyond Compatibility

Synastry tells you how two charts interact. It doesn't tell you:
- Whether someone is emotionally available
- Whether they've done their personal work
- Whether timing is right
- Whether you both want the same things

Compatibility is one factor. It's not the only factor.
